- 👋 Hi, I’m @PeresLisa
- 👀 I’m interested in self-sufficiency, discoveries as I'm fond of learning and sport.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning tones of stuffs but most specifically trying to rock on R with new abilities I don't master yet.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on code checks (both reviewing and getting reviewed).
